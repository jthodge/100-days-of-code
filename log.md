# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 2018-06-06

**Today's Progress**: R1D1: Invested ~1 hour into building Tic Tac Toe for my Recurse Center application. Using Canvas, constructed the board and implemented player marking in board spaces. Tomorrow I'll tackle the win condition logic.

**Thoughts:** No difficulties encountered in coding today since I'm famililar with the JS and Canvas needed today.  (Though I'm certain this lack of difficulty will change soon enough...) Feelings of warmth and support from the 100 Days of Code community members are bolstering, and it's lovely to be apart of such a welcoming and inviting space.
