# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### R1D1: 2018-06-06

**Today's Progress**: Invested ~1 hour into building Tic Tac Toe for my Recurse Center application. Using Canvas, constructed the board and implemented player marking in board spaces. Tomorrow I'll tackle the win condition logic.

**Thoughts:** No difficulties encountered in coding today since I'm famililar with the JS and Canvas needed today.  (Though I'm certain this lack of difficulty will change soon enough...) Feelings of warmth and support from the 100 Days of Code community members are bolstering, and it's lovely to be apart of such a welcoming and inviting space.

### R1D2: 2018-06-07

**Today's Progress**: The code I wrote yesterday smelled terrible so I invested my time today in refactoring it. I cleaned the global namespace by placing all loose variables in a general function called via a public API, and I generalized a couple of single-purpose functions. Everything is much cleaner, which will make it much easier to implement win conditioning.

**Thoughts:** Progress today was slow, but fruitful, as refactoring forced me to slow down and really consider how each function interacts with the others.

### R1D2: 2018-06-08

**Today's Progress**: Found a better way to determine move position, as well as a cute method of updating the current board state of a game. Currently thinking of ways to push drawn moves the updated board state...

**Thoughts:** Taking moves drawn to the canvas and pushing them to an updated board state is proving to be more difficult than I anticipated, which I'm feeling frustrated about. Waiting until so late into the day (night) definitely makes my thinking sluggish, so I'm eager to rethink this when I'm fresh.
